# Cryptography and Steganography Project  
### A Secure Data Communication System  

This project, developed using **Java** in **Visual Studio**, integrates **Cryptography** and **Steganography** techniques to ensure secure and confidential data communication.  

## Key Features:  
- **Cryptography**: Encrypts and decrypts messages using advanced algorithms, ensuring secure data exchange.  
- **Steganography**: Embeds encrypted messages within digital images, making the data invisible to unintended recipients.  
- **User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly design for seamless interaction.  
- **Robust Security**: Combines both techniques for enhanced data protection.  

## Technologies Used:  
- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio  
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Required for execution  

## How It Works:  
1. **Encrypt** your confidential message using a custom cryptographic algorithm.  
2. **Embed** the encrypted message into an image file using steganographic techniques.  
3. **Extract and Decrypt** the hidden message when needed, ensuring secure access.
